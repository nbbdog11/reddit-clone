# reddit-clone
A basic reddit clone implemented in <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and {front-end framework}.  
Uses <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">mongoDB</a> as a database, and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> as a web application framework on top of Node.  
I'll add build/deploy instructions soon.  
Also, I'm using <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a> to serve the application locally, but there's no reason to have to use it.
